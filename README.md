# CommunicationChannelSimulation

This is a project that simulate the physical layer of a communication channel. 
The input is a .txt and the output is another .txt that should arrive with none or maybe few errors.

We use a AWGN noise, and stablish a source encoder, channel encoder, and 4ASK modulation technique.

Run: python3 PhysicalLayerSimulation.py
